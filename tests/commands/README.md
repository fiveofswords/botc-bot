# Command Tests

Tests for bot commands:

- **test_player_commands.py** - Player-specific command tests (vote, hand actions, etc.)
- **test_storyteller_commands.py** - Storyteller command tests (game management, player actions)
- **test_settings_functionality.py** - Settings and configuration command tests

Uses fixtures from `tests/fixtures/` for consistent testing setup.
